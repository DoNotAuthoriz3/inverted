/* TODO: the aBrood abstract class should contain the prototypes for the
 * basic functions of the Brood class (which will be an in-memory B-tree
 * designed to serve the functions of arrays and linked lists dynamically.)
 *
 * Research for this class *may* or may not ever get around to determining
 * how main memory is sized and allocated and using that knowledge to set
 * the size of the array used for each node in the B tree.  It's possible
 * that that level of optimization will never prove necessary, although
 * when the project succeeds I anticipate that it WILL be necessary. */
