Ancient Legends of the Broken Lords: the Accursed Father


// -----------------------  SYNOPSIS ------------------------- //
Grauschere, an Aurigan boy, lives with his relatively primitive Aurigan tribe in a forest near an Endless outpost.  Tribal customs make the Endless outpost a forbidden place, and no one is allowed to speak with the strange beings there except the chief and the eldest shaman.  Grauschere, however, sneaks up to it one day and finds one of the strange beings, which smiles at him, and raises an arm to show him [Grauschere] his palm in a state of endless disintigration into a rising dust cloud.

Ten or fifteen years later, as a young-ish adult, he challenges the tribe's rules and revisits the outpost, befriending the same creature he first met there.  ... he is brought to an Endless ship, and is offered the chance to learn to fully know the Endless, but warned that it comes at the price of never being able to go back to what he was.  He is uploaded and becomes a Virtual Endless, and lives with the Endless many years, learning what that means.  Eventually he returns to Auriga, where he intends to be a liason between the ENndless and his species, but before he can get started the Dust Wars begin, and the Endless on Auriga begin warring.  He attempts to stay out of it, as do the other inhibitants of the settlement near his tribe, but as the war worsens all of his friends become casualties.  He leads a tribe of his people deep underground shortly before cave-ins and massive collapses indicate horrific calamity on the surface.

Eventually, he leads his people to the surface, but they struggle to survive with their corporeal needs amidst the barreness of the planet.  While he knows the planet will eventually recover, it won't fast enough for his people to survive.  He attempts to reproduce the process that converted him to a Virtual Endless, but the best copy he can discover of the process is corrupted and imperfect--he will be able to save his people by converting their consciousnesses to Dust networks, but only as a pale imitation of the functionality of the Virtual Endless.  Their control over the network of Dust that makes up their forms is sufficient for basic sensations, motions, and manipulation of the world around them (not to mention cognitive functions and emotion), but will never be capable of coalescing into fully-featured bodies like the Virtuals were capable of, and therefore will also never be capable of experiencing life like a living being again.

As his people began dying around him, he desperately searched for other options.  His knowledge of programming Dust was insufficient to use it to adequately transmute rocks or similar debris to edible food, but as the tribe returned to their lands they were able to forage enough food to sustain a fraction of the survivors.  Agonized, Grauschere watched as his people starved around him, until only those who could live off of what little remained on the land survived.  Finally convinced by the pleas of those dying around him to use his magic to help, he agreed to perform his broken Virtualization on them.

They awoke in new forms, ecstatic not just to have escaped death in the short term but to have escaped death forever.  Unfazed by the limitations of their new forms they began experimenting with the newfound powers it brought to manipulate Dust and the world around them.  Soon other tribespeople, even those who were finding plenty of food, began coming to Grauschere asking to be Virtualized.  Despite his misgivings about what they gave up as living beings, he acquiesced, and began Virtualizing his people in earnest.

Not too much longer, however, the first people to be transformed began to stop functioning--going slightly mad, unable to understand or remember of perform some simple thing in some simple way.  Educated enough to look at and understand some aspects of the algorithms and code they they consisted of, Grauschere learned that the Virtualization process he performed had another flow: another incomplete portion of the code enabled the virtual minds to self-heal and perform maintenance on themselves, similar to a brain repairing or rerouting pathways dynamically.  As the virtual minds functioned, small, almost innoticeable errors occurred and were bypassed.  As enough of these errors were bypassed with a corrective action to bring resolution to them, however, the minds began to fragment, the data and decisioning processes they depended on consisted of information with more and more small incongruities.

Again, Grauschere was confronted with a dliemma; his code was correct and fuctional, and he could potentially eventually reverse-engineer his own code and attempt to apply the missing pieces to the minds of his people.  However, his code was vast and his understanding of it tiny; it could be decades before he was able to reverse engineer it well enough and come up with a correct way to apply the code to dymanically add itself to each individual, instead of overwriting part of their personality with a carbon copy of his own.  However, Grauschere had happened to run across code related to observing the minds of others, and noting their decisions paths.  It was from that code that another idea was born: in a much shorter period of time, he could write code that would enable his Virtualized brethren to observe the cognitive functions of a healthy mind and compare the mappings that mind had and was making to its own, and use the incongruities to determine where the Virtualized mind had failed and repair it.

It was this code that Grauschere perfected, and gave provided as a patch to all of the broken Virtualized he knew.  As a living friend volunteered his own mind to be the sample, the most severely affected Virtualized activated the code.  What resulted staggered Grauschere.

The code brought the Dust of the Virtualized's form to life, as intended; that Dust entered the living body of the tribesman, as intended; but in order to determine the pathways used by that being's mind as instructed, the Dust was forced to improvise, and to disassemble that creature's cognitive network.  The code chain reacted in a process that disassembled the victims nervous system and finally its entire body.  The code worked; the Virtualized's mind was restored to correct functionality as the Dust applied what had been observed.  But the living tribesman had been consumed, permanently.  

Grauschere was appalled.  Determined not to let such monstrosities occur, he immediately attempted to remove the code from the Virtualized.  He was too late, however.  His patch had been too thorough; the code was fully integrated, and could not be removed without completely destroying the minds that contained it.  His people were reviled by what Grauschere had made them, and the knowledge that even if Grauschere developed an algorithm to repair their cognitions without the sacrifice of a living sentient, he would be unable to remove the code that forced them to do precisely that without destroying them.

It was the Virtualized themselves who, in their rage at the solution he had applied to them, turned Grauschere's algorithm on his own Virtual form; the Dust functioned no less ably on Grauschere than it had on the tribesman, and as his neuroprocessing network was torn apart the data retrieved cleansed the errors that had built up in his people.  But Grauschere had made a final breakthrough in his last moments; as his people consumed him, he spread this discovery through them.  Dust itself could, albeit far more slowly, enable the reconstruction of their faculties; while they might be degraded somewhat in ability if they survived purely on dust, rather than consuming the living, it could at least sustain their faculties in a sane state.

Grauschere's consumption rocked the population; the new code, and the partial integration of Grauschere's code, overwhelmed them.  Not only did his algorithm function as intended by depriving them of their memory of consuming the living, it overloaded their cognitive functions and sent them into a self-healing maintenance mode for centuries.  When they finally awake, Auriga had changed drastically from the past they had forgotten.

Robes rustled as they marched through the halls of the great house.  They marched in unison, they marched in armor, they marched in the reflected light of their own essence, and they marched without the sound of footsteps, for they had no feet.  Their oaths were--they must be--ended now.  For how could they uphold their oaths when they had become the very monsters they were sworn to defend the people against?  

One among their number shuddered, mentally, at what she was about to do, but she remained in pace.  Iegha dreaded the coming moments.  There could be no lower, no worse part of her life.  She did not believe that what she was about to do was right, although the less introspective of her companions did, but she knew that one way or another it must be done.  She had no great faith in fate or destiny, but she knew the coming battle--or, perhaps, execution--had to occur.  The consequences of his death, if he could be killed, would be the greatest and most terrible her dying, near-extinct people had yet endured.  His death would be a great evil and a great loss to all of their people.  But if they were to survive, if they were to retain even a shred of who they were, he had to be destroyed.

They were going to kill the Great Wizard, their savior.  They were going to kill the only man she'd ever loved.

373 years before:

Grauschere was a troublesome boy, though he didn't realize it yet.  He didn't agitate the other children, or play tricks on the old ladies vending wares in the streets; about the most bothersome thing he could imagine he did was to pester the old priest to recite the histories to him, as often as he could be made to.  But none of these these activities were any real bother to the parents in the village; a firm hand and a swift plank ensured their children were raised well.  What Grauschere was, what truly troubled his sire, was curious.  

It was a fine enough spring day.  His mother had insisted he leave the house, as his parents often enough did, and he had wondered to the forest again.  He was forbidden from going too deep into it lest he come across the fabled tower, a magical structure that housed strange and dangerous creatures.  Only nobles were permitted to visit the tower, and they always went with heavy guard.  The priest disliked speaking of the tower when Grauschere asked, and his parents disliked speaking of it to him even more than the priest.  He had occasionally overheard his mother and father discussing it when they thought he was asleep.  His parents were wealthy, for commoners, and had kept company with nobles before--Grauschere had even been to a banquet in a castle with his father once--and despite their blood, their profitable business and capable leadership acumen meant they were often swept up in the concerns of high life.  When they discussed the tower, they frequently talked about the "endless," although what that was he hadn't been able to figure out yet.  Grauschere suspected it was a magic token that couldn't be destroyed, or perhaps a book that recorded all of history.  Either way, he was patient enough to wait until he was older and had a right to find out.

What Grauschere was not, however, was observant.  As he wandered the parts of the forest he was permitted to visit, he had gotten altogether lost in his musings.  He did hope it was a book; a book he would like to be mentioned in one day, as a great leader who changed history.  He certainly hoped to accomplish something before he died; he knew tales of monsters that lived after death were merely stories, and although he thirsted to become such a monster--and go on enjoying the world forever.  If it were possible, he felt it must be worth it; he might be hunted by his neighbors, for stealing such unending life was rather incomprehensibly considered a crime, but Grauschere truly did love living and being in the world.  He knew that after he died, his spirit would live on in the afterlife...but he was in no hurry to get there.  There were so many beautiful things to do, so many adventures to experience, so much glory to be won that he couldn't imagine being satisfied with the miniscule amount he might do in a normal lifetime.  However, he was not still young enough to hope that he might become so unending a creature or that such fairy-tale monsters existed.  He had resigned himself to a short span of years, and the hope that his mind, his persona, might live on in some way in an unforgotten record...

As that thought trailed off, he realized he'd gotten a bit lost--he was in a portion of the forest he'd never visited before, near what appeared to be a meadow full of flowers.  Hoping the clearing would enable him to get his bearing--and perhaps pick a few choice blooms to bring his mother--he made for the bright patch of color he saw through the trees.  Emerging into the clearing, he saw a sight that made his breath catch in his throat.  He became acutely aware of the noise his heart made as it beat in his chest.

He stood across the meadow from an oddly beautiful tower.  Thick at the base, one side of it rose nearly straight up to the sky, taller than any building he'd ever seen.  The other side rose up, tilted slightly inward, about half the height of the building, then canted in, then resumed a steeper angle as it ascended to the peak.  There were no noticeable curves, just angles, and no visible bricks, just a smoother, glistening white Grauschere had never imagined.  At the base of the building was a black rectangle, like a door, but it seemed to be composed of pure shadow.  And a few steps away from the building, nearer Grauschere, stood a creature.

It was clearly not a beast--it stood on two legs, had two arms, appeared to wear clothes, and in other ways was like a person--but its features were not normal.  As he stood gawking it turned its head, locking gazes with him.  Its expression changed, slowly--Grauschere would not know it until much later, but it had smiled--and it slowly raised one arm up towards him, hand held so that its palm faced upward.  It was then Grauschere noticed that its palm glowed, as though its skin was breaking into little particles of dust that flowed upward like a soft flame.  Rapt, he watched as the creature's hand turned endlessly to glowing dust, but was never consumed, until suddenly he heard something that frightened him far more than this creature or the tower it stood before did.

His father's voice sounded like he had been shouting for a while; like he had, in fact, been searching the entire forest, and had nearly shouted himself hoarse.  Despite that, there was a burning iron in his voice that left Grauschere with no doubt that he would sorely regret being found here.

"What are you?"

The question was, perhaps, not the most tactful greeting Grauschere had ever offered, but it was at least pointed.  Grauschere didn't really know what else to say; if the Magi did prefer the showy displays he heard the nobles always put on when they visited, well, hopefully they would simpky chastise him and expel him for his presumption.

That hadn't seemed to be their inclination when he had inadvertantly trespassed in to the limited realm they claimed as their own in his youth, but who could know?  Clearly, the words of his parents and the local lords couldn't be relied on; even the more intellectually curious among them, who doubted the genuine imoortance of the rituals surrounding the Magi and the veracity of the superstitions that had grown aroumd them, simply shrugged off the possibility of learning any more about them.  Grauschere, however, performed no such metaphorical gesture when the topic of the Magi crossed his mind.  They were nearly the only unexplained phenomena he or anyone knew of, and strange happenings were invariably attributed to their actions regardless of how improbable the connection seemed.  Which might seem a minor offense to some, but the sheer affront it often presented to the practice of reason irked him.  It irked him in him in ways that other fallacies irked his father, a most reasonable man who was yet far more pragmatic than his child (and far less concerned with the nature or motivations of the Magi than he was with how they might affect his business or the whimsy of the local nobility).

All of that is what led Grauschere to the Tower of the Magi in the middle of the night.  The same magus he had encountered in his childhood stood outside, watching him silently as he had approached.  It stood silently still, though its expression changed to a small echo of that it had worn in his youth.  As the silence following his question grew, Grauschere began to wonder whether he should ask again, or perhaps say something else.  But the magus turned before he could, beckoning him to follow, and walked towards the shadow doorway of the tower.  The doorway gave him pause; it appeared no less like a solid shadow from arms length than it did across a field.  The magus had simply walked through it, however, and it had seemed to almosr flow around him, like stepping in to a wall of pure black water.  After a brief hesitation, he stepped through.

The interior of the building gave him no less pause, and he stopped halfway through the threshold until the door itself seemed to push him inside.  When he had first stepped in, the interior seemed like a whirlwind of dust in all the colors of the rainbow.  The shortest momend later the sdust had solidified into a perfect replica of the apartment he'd lived in all his life.  The magus was nowhere to be seen.

Seeing this, here...Grauschere knew he felt queer, but wasn't sure why.  What had he expected?  Some great wonder, perhaps, but not a building that changed shape, and certainly not one that changed shape to mimic its inhabitants' homes.  Was it wrong?  No, not quite, but it was...condescending, perhaps?
